## 📖 What Is cache-components-granular?

This application shows how to improve website speed by saving small parts of a page separately. It uses a special technique called "field-level granular caching." This means it stores only small pieces of content to load pages faster. 

The project works with Next.js 16, a popular tool that helps build websites. It focuses on caching fields, not entire pages, so the site can update parts quickly without reloading everything.

## 🖥 What You Can Do With This App

- See how caching helps webpages load parts faster.
- Learn how to save just small sections of data.
- Watch a live demo showing these improvements.
- Explore how Next.js 16 uses new caching methods.
- Test it on your own computer easily.

## ⚙ Using The App

Once the app opens, you’ll see a simple interface. Here's what to expect:

- A live example site showing content sections.
- Buttons to refresh, clear cache, or view cached parts.
- Information on how long each part is saved.

Try clicking "Refresh" to see how the app loads content fast using cached fields.

You can also clear the cache and try again to notice the difference.

## 🔍 About The Demo

The demo focuses on:

- Showing field-level caching for small data pieces instead of whole pages.
- Using Next.js 16’s new features like React Server Components.
- Combining caching with partial prerendering to improve speed.
- Using popular tools like Tailwind CSS for design and TypeScript for safe code.

It helps developers or curious users understand performance gains and how cache-controls work behind the scenes.

## 💡 Why Field-Level Caching Matters

Normally, websites cache entire pages or large parts, causing delays when even small bits update.

This project shows caching only the changed fields, so:

- Pages load faster.
- Updates happen quicker.
- The server works less.
- Users see fresh data without full reloads.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try these steps:

- Ensure your system meets the requirements listed above.
- Check your internet connection if downloading fails.
- Extract the ZIP file fully before running the app.
- If the app won't start, try right-click > Run as administrator (Windows).
- Restart your computer and try again.
- Update your system and browser for best results.
